# Preparedness Assessment

# Just understanding how to start took awhile
# Noticed the parameters in the import were greyed out so I removed them
# App.js was looking messy so I realized I needed to move that code to the component
# App.js should only have 1 return
# First real problem was to solve was getting functionality in the click me button (that way too long)
#!modal > false
#orginally thought to put the background image into the App.css but learned you can pull it from the assets into your index.css
#Do I need the close button in the modal component or is the X fine?
#used google to find the CSS commands
